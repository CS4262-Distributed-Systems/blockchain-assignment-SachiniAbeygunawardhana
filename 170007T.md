## Concepts that I learnt about Blockchains


1.Transaction ordering is done by the ordering service, while letting peers to totally focus on validating transactions and committing them to the ledger. When there are multiple ordering nodes, a consensus algorithm is used to agree on an order of transactions.

2.All the transactions are validated before committed to the ledger. To ensure the validity, the transactions are signed by multiple organizations. In this way, no organization can interfere with the ledger in an unfair manner. The transactions are committed to the ledger only if the output is consistent and it has been signed by sufficient organizations.

3.Security can be ensured in blockchains by various means, such as using public key infrastructure. All the nodes, network administrators and users are given a unique identity, which is used to verify their actions in the network. These identities have a valid root of trust. When using public key infrastructure, cryptogen tool or certificate authorities can be used to create the certificates and keys.
